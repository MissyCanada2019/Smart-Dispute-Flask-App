# Debugging Report - Enhanced Health Check Functionality

## Overview
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the enhanced health check functionality implemented for the Smart Dispute Canada Flask application and outlines the debugging approach that should be taken to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Implementation Summary

### Enhanced Health Check Features
1. **Memory Usage Monitoring** - Monitors system memory usage and reports warnings for high usage
2. **CPU Usage Monitoring** - Monitors CPU usage and reports warnings for high usage
3. **Disk Space Monitoring** - Monitors disk space usage and reports warnings for high usage
4. **Environment Variable Validation** - Validates critical environment variables are set
5. **SSL Certificate Validation** - Checks SSL certificate validity for the main domain
6. **Cache Service Connectivity** - Tests cache service connectivity (Redis/Memcached)
7. **Email Service Connectivity** - Tests email service connectivity (SMTP)
8. **Enhanced Database Statistics** - Provides more detailed database statistics

### Files Modified
1. `utils/error_handling.py` - Added all new health check methods and updated the main health check function
2. `requirements.txt` - Added `psutil==5.9.5` dependency

## Debugging Approach

### 1. Dependency Verification
The first step in debugging should be to verify that all dependencies are properly installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Specifically, ensure that `psutil` is installed and working correctly.

### 2. Individual Health Check Testing
Test each health check method individually to identify any issues:

1. **Memory Usage Check**
   - Verify psutil can access memory information
   - Check if memory usage reporting is accurate

2. **CPU Usage Check**
   - Verify psutil can access CPU information
   - Check if CPU usage reporting is accurate

3. **Disk Space Check**
   - Verify psutil can access disk information
   - Check if disk usage reporting is accurate

4. **Environment Variable Check**
   - Verify critical environment variables are detected correctly
   - Check if missing variables are reported properly

5. **SSL Certificate Check**
   - Verify domain connectivity
   - Check if certificate expiration is calculated correctly

6. **Cache Service Check**
   - Verify cache service configuration is detected
   - Check if cache service connection works

7. **Email Service Check**
   - Verify email service configuration is detected
   - Check if email service connection works

8. **Database Statistics Check**
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check if table count query works correctly

### 3. Integration Testing
Test the integration of all health check methods with the Flask application:

1. Run the Flask application locally:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Access the health check endpoint:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

3. Verify that all health check methods are called and return expected results

### 4. Performance Testing
Ensure that the enhanced health check functionality doesn't cause performance issues:

1. Check that all health check methods complete within a reasonable time
2. Verify that the health check doesn't overload system resources
3. Ensure that the health check can handle concurrent requests

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: psutil Import Errors
**Symptoms**: ImportError when trying to import psutil
**Solution**: 
- Run `pip install psutil` to install the library
- Check if psutil is compatible with the Python version
- Verify that psutil has necessary permissions to access system information

### Issue 2: SSL Certificate Validation Failures
**Symptoms**: SSL certificate check fails with connection errors
**Solution**:
- Check network connectivity to the domain
- Verify firewall or proxy settings aren't blocking the connection
- Ensure the domain name is correct in the code

### Issue 3: Environment Variable Validation Issues
**Symptoms**: Environment variable check reports missing variables that should be present
**Solution**:
- Check `.env` file for required variables
- Verify environment variable loading in the application
- Ensure variables are exported correctly in the environment

### Issue 4: Cache Service Connectivity Issues
**Symptoms**: Cache service check fails with connection errors
**Solution**:
- Check if Redis/Memcached is properly configured
- Verify cache service connection parameters
- Ensure cache service is running and accessible

### Issue 5: Email Service Connectivity Issues
**Symptoms**: Email service check fails with connection errors
**Solution**:
- Check SMTP server settings in environment variables
- Verify email service credentials
- Ensure email service is accessible

## Debugging Scripts
Several debugging scripts have been created to facilitate testing:

1. `test_health_check.py` - A comprehensive test script for the health check functionality
2. `debug_health_check.py` - A detailed debug script that tests individual health check methods
3. `simple_debug.py` - A simplified debug script for basic testing

## Conclusion
The enhanced health check functionality has been implemented following best practices and should provide comprehensive monitoring of the application's health. The debugging approach outlined in this report should help identify and resolve any issues that may arise during deployment or operation.
