# Enhanced Health Check Functionality - Summary

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the enhanced health check functionality implemented for the Smart Dispute Canada Flask application.

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Memory Usage Monitoring
- Added `check_memory_usage()` method to monitor system memory usage
- Reports memory usage percentage and available memory
- Includes warnings for high memory usage (>75%) and critical usage (>90%)

### 2. CPU Usage Monitoring
- Added `check_cpu_usage()` method to monitor CPU usage
- Reports CPU usage percentage
- Includes warnings for high CPU usage (>75%) and critical usage (>90%)

### 3. Disk Space Monitoring
- Added `check_disk_usage()` method to monitor disk space usage
- Reports disk usage percentage and available space
- Includes warnings for high disk usage (>75%) and critical usage (>90%)

### 4. Environment Variable Validation
- Added `check_environment_variables()` method to validate critical environment variables
- Checks for the presence of `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `FLASK_ENV`
- Reports missing variables that could cause application issues

### 5. SSL Certificate Validation
- Added `check_ssl_certificates()` method to validate SSL certificates for the main domain
- Checks certificate expiration dates
- Reports days until certificate expiration with warnings for certificates expiring within 14 days

### 6. Cache Service Connectivity
- Added `check_cache_service()` method to test cache service connectivity
- Supports Redis and Memcached
- Reports connection status and any connection errors

### 7. Email Service Connectivity
- Added `check_email_service()` method to test email service connectivity
- Tests SMTP server connection
- Reports connection status and any connection errors

### 8. Enhanced Database Statistics
- Enhanced `check_database()` method to include table count information
- Provides more detailed database statistics in health check results

## Implementation Details

### File Modifications
1. **utils/error_handling.py**:
   - Added imports for `psutil` library with fallback handling
   - Added `check_memory_usage()` method
   - Added `check_cpu_usage()` method
   - Added `check_disk_usage()` method
   - Added `check_environment_variables()` method
   - Added `check_ssl_certificates()` method
   - Added `check_cache_service()` method
   - Added `check_email_service()` method
   - Enhanced `check_database()` method with table count statistics
   - Updated `get_health_status()` method to include all new checks

2. **requirements.txt**:
   - Added `psutil==5.9.5` dependency

### Code Changes
The enhanced health check functionality gracefully handles cases where optional services aren't configured, reporting them as healthy with an appropriate message.

## Potential Issues and Debugging Steps

### 1. Dependency Issues
- **psutil library**: Ensure psutil is properly installed and compatible with the system
  - Run `pip install psutil` to install the library
  - Check if psutil has necessary permissions to access system information

### 2. SSL Certificate Validation Issues
- **Network connectivity**: Ensure the domain "smartdisputecanada.me" is accessible
  - Check network connectivity to the domain
  - Verify firewall or proxy settings aren't blocking the connection

### 3. Environment Variable Validation Issues
- **Missing variables**: Ensure critical environment variables are set
  - Check `.env` file for required variables
  - Verify environment variable loading in the application

### 4. Cache Service Connectivity Issues
- **Service availability**: Ensure cache service is running and accessible
  - Check if Redis/Memcached is properly configured
  - Verify cache service connection parameters

### 5. Email Service Connectivity Issues
- **SMTP configuration**: Ensure email service is properly configured
  - Check SMTP server settings in environment variables
  - Verify email service credentials

## Testing
A test script (`test_health_check.py`) was created to facilitate testing of the enhanced health check functionality. Additionally, a debug script (`debug_health_check.py`) was created to help identify potential issues.

## Deployment
The enhanced health check functionality is ready for deployment. The implementation is backward compatible and will gracefully handle cases where optional services aren't configured.

## Conclusion
The enhanced health check functionality provides comprehensive monitoring of the application's health, including system resources, environment configuration, and service connectivity. This will help identify potential issues before they affect users and provide valuable diagnostic information for troubleshooting.
