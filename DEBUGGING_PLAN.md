# Debugging Plan for Enhanced Health Check Functionality

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to debug the enhanced health check functionality for the Smart Dispute Canada Flask application.

## Potential Issues to Investigate

### 1. Dependency Issues
- **psutil library**: The enhanced health check functionality relies on the psutil library for system monitoring
  - Verify that psutil is properly installed
  - Check if the version is compatible with the application
  - Ensure psutil can access system information

### 2. SSL Certificate Validation Issues
- **SSL certificate checking**: The enhanced health check includes SSL certificate validation
  - Verify that the domain "smartdisputecanada.me" is accessible
  - Check if there are any network connectivity issues
  - Ensure SSL/TLS libraries are properly configured

### 3. Environment Variable Validation Issues
- **Environment variable checking**: The enhanced health check validates critical environment variables
  - Verify that required environment variables are set
  - Check if the validation logic correctly identifies missing variables

### 4. Cache Service Connectivity Issues
- **Cache service checking**: The enhanced health check includes cache service connectivity testing
  - Verify that the cache service configuration is correct
  - Check if the Redis client library is properly installed
  - Ensure the cache service is accessible

### 5. Email Service Connectivity Issues
- **Email service checking**: The enhanced health check includes email service connectivity testing
  - Verify that the email service configuration is correct
  - Check if the smtplib library is properly installed
  - Ensure the email service is accessible

### 6. Database Statistics Issues
- **Database statistics**: The enhanced health check includes more detailed database statistics
  - Verify that the database query for table count works correctly
  - Check if the database connection is stable
  - Ensure the database statistics don't cause performance issues

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify Dependencies
1. Check if all required libraries are installed:
   - flask
   - psutil
   - redis (optional)
   - sqlalchemy
2. Verify library versions are compatible

### Step 2: Test Individual Health Check Methods
1. Test memory usage monitoring
2. Test CPU usage monitoring
3. Test disk space monitoring
4. Test environment variable validation
5. Test SSL certificate validation
6. Test cache service connectivity
7. Test email service connectivity
8. Test database statistics

### Step 3: Test Integration with Flask Application
1. Verify that the health check methods work within the Flask application context
2. Check if there are any issues with the application configuration
3. Ensure the health check endpoint returns the expected results

### Step 4: Performance Testing
1. Check if the enhanced health check functionality causes any performance issues
2. Verify that all health check methods complete within a reasonable time
3. Ensure the health check doesn't overload system resources

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If psutil is not working:
1. Reinstall psutil: `pip install psutil`
2. Check if psutil has the necessary permissions to access system information
3. Verify that psutil is compatible with the operating system

### If SSL certificate validation fails:
1. Check network connectivity to the domain
2. Verify that the domain name is correct
3. Check if there are any firewall or proxy issues

### If environment variable validation fails:
1. Check if the required environment variables are set
2. Verify that the validation logic is correct
3. Ensure that the environment variables have the correct values

### If cache service connectivity fails:
1. Check if the cache service is running
2. Verify that the cache service configuration is correct
3. Ensure that the Redis client library is properly installed

### If email service connectivity fails:
1. Check if the email service is accessible
2. Verify that the email service configuration is correct
3. Ensure that the smtplib library is properly installed

### If database statistics fail:
1. Check if the database is accessible
2. Verify that the database query for table count works correctly
3. Ensure that the database connection is stable

## Conclusion
This debugging plan should help identify and resolve any issues with the enhanced health check functionality. By following these steps systematically, we should be able to ensure that the enhanced health check works correctly in all environments.
